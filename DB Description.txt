We can make it simple:

User:
    DiscordID 
    Timezone (enum) <- no enum, integer representing difference from UTC

Interval:
    ID
    UserID (one to many)
    Day (enum)  <- no enum, integer representing day (0 = Sun, 1 = Mon, 2 = Tue)
    StartHour
    EndHour


This way a user can have whatever intervals he/she chooses:
Monday 12-14 and 16-18
Tuesday 13-17, 18-20, 23-24
etc
Or if we use something like mongo:
{
    "user_id": "string",
    "timezone": "from an enum",
    "availability_intervals": [
          {
                "day": "Monday",
                "starthour": 10,
                "endhour": 14
          },....
    ]
}

Maybe sqlite3 cause it's the easiest:
